<p>Buying a new stainless steel sports Rolex is hard irrespective of how much money you have or who you might know. Buying a vintage Rolex is an order of magnitude more challenging.</p>
<p>The market in 2020 is more competitive and challenging than ever before, despite economic and public health problems. While short term interest and prices may have softened, long term demand and prices continue to trend upwards - as have unscrupulous market participants. Buyers have to contend with flippers, unscrupulous watchmakers, thieves, scammers, and outright counterfeiters. And then there are the watches themselves with their questionable condition, correctness, and authenticity.</p>
<p> Perhaps because of these very challenges, vintage Rolex is still so highly prized and desirable. And in some circles, even more so than the hard to buy new ones. The gradually declining global inventory, and steadily rising prices make for an intoxicating mix of scarcity and urgency which quickly clouds common sense and rational logic.</p>
<p>Step One in acquiring one of these prized watches is to know what was actually made. Enter the new Vintage Rolex Field Manual Chevalier Edition - a comprehensive catalog of models and specifications, written for both buyers and sellers.<p>
</p> While only Rolex knows the exact production volume, we know what models were made and when. We also have a good idea of the variations in each model reference, along with which movements and calibers they would have contained.</p>
<p> The most desirable and collectable vintage Rolex today are the sporting models contained in the Professional Collection. There are ten model lines in the Professional Collection, numbering 196 distinct references.</p>

<div style="padding: 50px;">

<p>Within each model line there are numerous reference variations to contend with. Their production periods, presumed production volume, and prices, can vary widely despite their microscopic cosmetic differences.</p>
<p>Take for example the popular Explorer, designed for mountaineers and speleologists with the 24 variants. In addition to the two major variations with their widely different aesthetics and complications, there are six references that were dual-branded with the Air-King. These can be very challenging to assess for correctness and authenticity.</p>

</div>

<p> Learn more about these dual-branded references, their challenges and details in Chapter 7.</p>

<p>Also to consider are the movements. A model seemingly uniform like the Submariner, could have one of 14 different movements. Some of these shared interchangeable parts, and others shared entirely interchangeable movements. This can make it almost impossible to determine if a movement was the one the original watch left the factory with. Or whether it is a transplant, known in the trade as a franken-watch (made up from spare parts). </p>

</div>

<p>When considering a Rolex Submariner, it's important to understand the overlapping history with the less famous Rolex Sea-Dweller. This lesser known dive-watch has an equally well-deserved reputation as an elite tool watch.</p>

<p>Like the Rolex Submariner it has it's own nicknames, variations and nuances. Many would argue this is the more collectable of the dive watches, while others warn it can be harder to wear casually on smaller wrists.</p>

</div>

<p>Buyers and collectors need to have some sense of what these movements look like and how to identify them, including the tell-tale signs of good or poor maintenance. Chapter 11 will provide this insight without actually turning you into a watchmaker.</p>
<p>In addition to knowing if a vintage Rolex has “all the right bits” it is necessary to know how to assess condition. Not only what to look at, but also to know what can be done to restore a distressed watch and hide past damage. A heavily distressed watch can be restored and refinished to be indistinguishable from a premium condition example, so prized by elite collectors. Chapters 2 and 5 will arm you with what you need to know.</p>
<p>At only $85 The Vintage Rolex Field Manual Chevalier Edition is a trivial price to pay for a comprehensive education that could save you tens of thousands of dollars in expensive mistakes. Buy it now from your favorite bookstore or right here.</p>
