# Publishing
Selecting a POD publishing partner starts with the question, "Wide or Narrow distribution?". If you are comfortable with Narrow, then your choices are limited to Amazon KDP.

Wide distribution means making your book available to the widest number of retailers as possible. Reach, price and services are a trade-off, depending on your own needs and circumstances.

Several companies offer POD and wide distribution, and three of the best known are, 

* [Publishdrive](https://publishdrive.com)
* [Ingramspark](https://ingramspark.com)
* [Draft2Digital](https://draft2digital.com/)

As competitors, their service offerings and prices evolve and and need to be assessed when you're ready to print. So a trade study of their prices and service catalog won't age well if documented here.

At a minimum you should be concerned with,
* Print quality (paper, finish, ink, trim sizes etc)
* Print service (fulfillment time, return and refund policy etc)
* Royalty rates and payment schedule
* Minimum print volume of One book
* Drop shipping direct to your customers
* Access to traditional print book industry supply chain
* Access to digital e-book markets
* Cost and turnaround time on revisions and updates
* Shipping rates and packaging quality
* Global reach and regional print and fulfillment

# Purchasing & Payment
Author royalty payments are typically ~90 days in arrears. Meaning a book sold in January won't generate an author payment until April.

How you elect to receive this payment is an important consideration -- check, bank deposit, Paypal. This is especially important if you are not in the same country as your POD partner. Foreign bank deposit fees, exchange rates and other transaction fees can eat into modest royalty payments. Enquire about these in advance.

When purchasing your print books from your POD partner, look for fees such as handling fees and card processing fees. Also enquire about seasonal promotions and volume discounts. This can be helpful when timing the launch of your book and purchasing your own inventory. e.g. Ingramspark typically offer volume discount promotions in mid summer.
