# Introduction

This is for independent and self-published authors of *non-fiction* books. If you're a fiction author you might get some ideas but it's not aimed at you. The workflow, tools and philosophy are specific for non-fiction work.

The formulas and tips are most well suit to cookbooks, coffee-table books, reference manuals, travel guides, biographies, instructional tutorials, catalogs, educational text books. They don't translate well to fiction genres.

This guide is not intended for academic, legal, scientific, or governmental documents. These have their own well established standards and conventions.

## Non-Fiction Only
Non-fiction books tend to make heavy use of elements like tables, lists, charts, diagrams, images, foot notes, bibliographies, and indexes. While these can appear in fiction books, they're less prominent or necessary, serving as embellishments rather than core content. These items can be tedious, time consuming and expensive to typeset. 

The non-fiction market is distinctly different from fiction markets. Genres, specialties and sub-specialties tend to be narrow and deep. These niches are smaller and often highly technical.
This makes for a different price and profitability equation.

# Intellectual Property, Copyright, Privacy, & Piracy

## IP Protections
Don't be paranoid. The chances your work is good enough to steal is low. The chances of industry professionals (like editors and designers) stealing your work is even lower. Unless you're an acclaimed author, their reputations are worth more than yours. 

Worrying about non-disclosure agreements to avoid plagiarism and theft is a waste of time. Focus your effort on getting your work to market as quickly and efficiently  as possible with the highest quality work you can achieve. 

**Photographs** belong to the photographer that pressed the shutter button. If you use third party photography check the usage rights and acknowledge the source in the Front Matter of your book.

**Fonts** are usually free for private and commercial use if they come from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) or [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts). Not all fonts are free and you may need to pay to use them. If you don't wish to buy fonts, specify this to your graphic designer(s).

## Copyright
Maintain backups and versions of your work with timestamps. This is sufficient to demonstrate to a lawyer (or Judge) you produced the original work and the timeline. You do not need to register your book with the US Copyright Office to receive copyright protections. 

However, if you're really concerned you can register your copyright for a small fee (~$35) at [copyright.gov](https://www.copyright.gov/). This must be filed BEFORE you publish and go to market, and can't be done retrospectively.

Mark any draft work you send out with your name and copyright notice.

Legally enforcing a copyright infringement is an expensive and time consuming process. You will need excellent documentation evidence, a rock-solid legal case, and substantial financial means.

## Piracy
Don't engage in theft. Period. Whether that be software tools or other peoples content.

If a pirate steals your finished book, you will need an extraordinarily strong case and substantial legal means to prosecute a perpetrator.

Digital anti-piracy controls on e-books are easily removed and only annoy users. They're not worth the time or effort to implement.

Anyone can issue a [DMCA Take Down Notice](https://www.dmca.com/FAQ/What-is-a-DMCA-Takedown) but don't be surprised if it is ignored. Prosecuting an offender is difficult and expensive. Only bother if your revenue loss significantly exceeds legal fees.

##  Privacy & Pen Names
Many authors write under a pseudonym or pen name. This is far more common than many new authors realize.

The only time you need to disclose your name is to get paid. You do not need any legal constructs to maintain your anonymity as an author. You do not need to establish any legal entity (such as an LLC or Trust) to use a Pen Name.

To further protect your privacy, subscribe for a mailing box at your local UPS Store, Kinkos or Post Office. These can be had for ~$200 per year. Use this address for all your professional communications, registrations, advertising and promotions, including your website. 

When selecting a mail box vendor take into consideration and compare benefits and incentives. These can include,
* discounts on postage rates
* holding of outsized boxes (of books) 
* printing (business cards, promotional merchandise)
* copying and notary services
* access and opening hours
* email notifications (mail arrival)
