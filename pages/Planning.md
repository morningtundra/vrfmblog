## [Topic Research](#topic-research)
Choosing a topic or subject is a personal and subjective choice. You'll want a subject you have some passing interest in, as you’ll be spending considerable time immersed in it. *Don't* pick a subject because you think it’s an uncompetitive genre with lots of opportunity (Dutch Accounting Regulations and Bookkeeping Practices of the late 19th Century).

It is assumed you have (or plan to acquire) subject matter expertise *before* embarking on the development of a book. It's reasonable to acquire knowledge as you go, but unrealistic to think you can start from zero knowledge.

The goal is to produce a book with sufficient value to convince someone to buy it (and hopefully satisfy them once they've done so!). The price they're willing to pay depends on the perceived value they expect to get. The content needs to be perceived as,

* better than average
* more than what they already have or know
* beyond what they can get for free

If you want to charge a premium price then it needs to be perceived as **much** better. If you can't satisfy all three (relatively low) criteria, you can expect critical and negative reviews.

How you actually perform research depends entirely on the topic. Researching a travel guide needs field work. Researching a cookbook needs kitchen experimentation. This is knowledge acquisition and beyond the scope of this guide.

## Assessing Competition 
The first step is to search Amazon, then visit your local library and one or more book stores. You’re trying to answer the question, “Is this genre overcrowded?”. It’s ok to find lots of books but not ok if you find hundreds of books. 

Amazon returns over 9,000 results for "books on programming for the web" but 52 results for "books on vintage watch collecting". You want to validate demand but don’t want to take on intense and established competition.

Pay close attention to what you find and specifically what you like - Do you like big books or small? Hardcover or paperback? Large fonts and white space or small and tightly packed? Do you like wide margins or narrow? Where do you like the page numbers? Do you need an Index or will a Table Of Contents suffice? Make note of what you like and take measurements with a ruler. Take phone photos of books and pages you like. You’ll need these to create a Design Brief.

**Pro Tip:** An index is complex and expensive to produce. Think carefully about whether you really need one. The same goes for hard covers and dust jackets.

Assess the price range, and note the highest and the lowest priced books in the genre (sort search results by price). You definitely don’t want to be the cheapest but you do want your title associated and listed alongside the best in the genre.

Google the author of the most expensive books to see if they really have the credentials, qualifications and track record to command a premium price. Is it even a real name or a pen name? This will help you decide if you can (or want) to compete in the top end of the price range. 

Ideally, you want to compete with a couple of dozen high profile titles in a genre. This validates the market opportunity and indicates the level of quality you will need to achieve. 

Pay attention to the cheapest titles with the worst or fewest reviews. Can you identify why they were not successful? 

* Poor production quality (paper, print, size)
* Poor narrative quality (lack of editing)
* Poor interior book design (layout, illustrations, typography)
* Poor cover design or title
* Weak back blurb
* Incorrect, missing, incomplete content

## Book Architecture
In Google Docs, write out what your Table of Contents page would look like. You’ll have an idea of what should be in the Beginning, Middle and End based on the competing titles you examined when assessing the competitive landscape. This exercise is called “stubbing out the manuscript” and will give you a skeleton framework for your book. You’ll have Chapters, Sections and Subsections with provisional titles.

You'll find this super helpful when you get to [Writing](Writing.md).

All books have boiler plate preamble called Front Matter which typically include: 

* Credits & Acknowledgements 
* Copyright & Legal Note
* Dedication
* Preface
* Table Of Contents
   
Take a close look at the front matter in other books. Copy them if you need to but be sure to customize and modify for your book.

Chapter 1 should be an Introduction. The final chapter should be an Epigraph or Conclusion. Aim for about a dozen chapters for the main body of the book.

The entire book should contain 20,000 to 40,000 words depending on the genre. Chapters will want to be similarly sized and organized with subsections (where needed). Something in the order of 2,500 to 3,000 words per chapter is comfortable to read and relatively easy to write.

Depending on the design choices you make later, this will cover approximately 250 to 300 pages, of a book 1" to 1.5" thick, and weighing about 1lb. This is a sweet spot for cost effective shipping and handling. 

Production costs (editing, design, printing) are directly related to word count. A large book cost more to produce. Digital POD companies will price a color book assuming all pages are full color (not on the amount of ink actually used). While ***less is more*** it makes sense to take advantage of what you will pay for.

## Pricing
Are the highest priced books in your genre expensive to produce? It’s possible the most expensive books have a low profit margin for the author. It’s also reasonable to assume the cheapest books have very modest profit margins too.

If you want to turn a profit, you want a book that’s not too expensive to print and yet priced attractively compared to others on the same shelf.

It is advisable to price higher than you're comfortable with. This will give you headroom to offer promotional discounts and affiliate commissions. It's much easier to reduce the price after launch than raise it.

The final retail price will be a trade-off between actual production cost, retailer discount and your margin.

* Production costs will be a function of page count, paper quality, cover finish and ink
* Reseller discounts range from 35% to 75% and set by the author
* POD handling fees which vary by company
* Your authors margin


## Audience Research
It's a tired cliche to tell you to get to know your audience. After all, you're writing a book you yourself are interested in, and likely to buy. The question is, are you a complete weird, oddball, one of a kinda? Chances are, no. None of us are unique, individual or special enough to be a tribe of one.

So what does your tribe look for and how do they behave? The most obvious place to look are internet forums. There are forums on every conceivable niche interest and they can look like Facebook Groups to Newsletters. The questions you're looking to answer are,

* How many forums are there? 
* How many users do they have? 
* How active are the forums?

The goal is not to take an accurate census but to gauge whether there is a viable and hopefully vibrant market for your book. 

If you find relatively few communities with low traffic, this does not bode well. If you find active communities, join them. Sign up to their mailing lists and accept their notifications. 

There are techniques later describing how to extract value from these spammy notifications and email communications.

## Self vs Traditional Publishing

Never pay someone to publish your work. Period. A print or publishing company that asks you to do this is a vanity press and should be avoided.

There are numerous perks to being traditionally published by a publishing house. However the odds of cutting a deal worth your time, are against you. 

Independent self-publishing has never been cheaper or easier to do. You should note that cheap is not free as there are modest costs involved.

Those that tell you self-publishing is hard, really mean it's hard to make a full time living at it. The technical process is quite simple but turning a profit, or making even a modest income is indeed hard. But if you're patient, persistent and curious, self-publishing can be a profitable side-hustle. 

Self-publishing is intimately linked with digital printing on demand (POD). There are several companies that offer these services:

* Ingramspark.com
* Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP)
* Others

The scope of their services ranges from all-in to more specialized and focused. An all-in, soup-to-nuts POD service would include,

* Book printing with no minimum volume
* High production quality, in many trim sizes, cover styles and finishes.
* International handling and drop shipping
* Global distribution of both print and digital books
* Automated author royalty payments
* Handling of retailer discounts and returns
* Accounting & reporting or authors sales and earnings
* Marketing & Advertising
* Tech support & Service Desk

## Wide vs Narrow Distribution

Wide distribution makes your book available to multiple  retailers. This includes online like Amazon and Apple, as well as brick and mortar stores like Barnes & Noble and Waterstones.

Narrow distribution typically involves exclusivity. Publishing with Amazon KDP is narrow in the sense your book will not be sold outside the Amazon market place.

Each strategy has distinct advantages. Seasoned self-published authors advocate for a mixed hybrid approach. While it's true there are some benefits, the advantages are only significant when/if your books sells at scale. 

The complexity of managing multiple channels is not worth it for your first or even second book. It is a strategy worth examining once you've achieved relative success and want to optimize your burgeoning business to maximize profit.

## Print vs Digital

For the non-fiction genre, you should prioritize and target print format before digital or electronic formats (this is reverse for fiction). 

* e-Readers and e-Book file formats (and their standards) are a complex domain. There are competing standards and device makers implement them inconsistently. 

* Unless your book has simple content and layout (mostly text) you will have to design for the various devices and resolutions. This is feasible but not trivial.

* Proprietary formats promoted by Amazon and Apple attempt to address shortcomings in Open Standards. These have the unfortunate consequence of locking you into their marketplace and ecosystem.

* Reflow-able Digital Format allows for fonts to change and  resize according to the orientation and resolution of the device and the users preference. This is helpful for reading long narrative text. This removes typography, custom fonts and pagination. Dynamic text wrapping can make tables and vector illustrations unreadable. It can also reposition illustrations and callout boxes away from the narrative that refers to them.

* Fixed Digital Format is something of a work-around. It attempts to convert tables and callout panels to images.  Multi column page layouts can get converted to raster images to maintain their correct sequence and flow. This makes the book a collection of images, rendering it unsearchable by keyword or hyperlinked TOC and Index.

The prevailing advice is to focus on producing a high quality print book. Depending on the final result, choose which electronic format best suites your print version.




## Language Translations

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers) these are the top 3 most widely spoken languages.

|Language|Speakers|% of Population|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Mandarin|~918M|~12%|
|Spanish|~480M|~6%|
|English|~379M|~5%|
