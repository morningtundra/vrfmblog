The process of content writing is easier if you have a framework to guide you. In effect you are populating the empty sections.

**Stubbing Your Manuscript** is something you will have started during the [Planning](Planning) phase. Use this list of chapters and sections as cues to guide your writing.

A helpful way to begin a section is with any diagrams and images you want to include. These are not finished artwork but placeholders. Sketch by hand on paper, crude pictures of what you want. Photograph them with your phone and insert these into your manuscript. 

Annotated timelines or flow charts can be helpful to spur the creative writing process.

# [Keeping Assets Organized](keeping-assets-organized)


As your document grows it will become necessary to cut and paste whole chapters into their own document. You will know it is time to do this when the web browser or word processor becomes slow to load, or sluggish to scroll and navigate.

It is helpful to number your chapters, sections and subsections. The point at which you break your manuscript into separate smaller files is an excellent time to implement this and tidy things up.

This numbering is for your own organization and facilitates easier communication with your editor and illustrator. Don't worry if numbers get out of sequence as you move sections around, as they'll be removed at the end. They serve only to help you find and reference things.

Consider using this convention,

    1.0 Chapter Name

        1.1 Section Name

            1.1.1 Subsection

Keep the Table Of Contents separate in it's own file or part of Chapter 0, containing the Front Matter.

Chapters will grow and accumulate assets like images, data, notes, references and other writing aids. These should be grouped into folders (sub directories) that follow the same naming and numbering convention. These reference numbers should be carried down to filenames for elements like images and tables etc.

It is likely that you will need to move around large sections of the manuscript. Structural changes of sequence can enhance the user experience, but may not be obvious to the author. These changes typically emerge during editing. Numbering can make these changes much easier, saving you precious time and energy. But don't obsess over renumbering if you move things around. 

Well organized and consistently numbered components can greatly simplify things for book layout designers and typesetters. This will save them time and by extension, saving your budget.


# Writing Tools
Deciding what tool to write with can be a source of procrastination. All you *need* is a word processor. The cheapest and easiest to use is Google Docs. This is your best option because,

* It is platform-neutral and doesn't care whether you're a Mac or PC person
* It is useable when you are out of office and don't have access to your own equipment 
* It is mobile-friendly for capturing notes, and images on the go
* Your content is backed-up and secured 
* It allows you to share and collaborate on documents
* It exports to formats like MS Word and even straight to EPUB
* It is integrated with [Spreadsheets](https://sheets.google.com) and [Drawing tools](https://docs.google.com/drawings) for easy embedding
* Offers native phone and tablet apps

Google offers other free services that will be used when you get to [Advertising and Marketing](Marketing.md). So it makes sense to get comfortable with Google's general conventions.

* Grammarly.com is a third party tool that is highly recommended. It is more than a grammar and spell checker. The full paid version will help with your citations, check for potential plagiarism and benefit your emails, marketing and website copy too. Grammarly is not popular with creative fiction writers.

# Illustrations

Illustrations can be a source of procrastination and distraction. Leave production of high fidelity graphics to the [Design](Design.md) phase. However, it may be necessary to produce low fidelity illustrations and graphics like maps, charts, drawings.

Any illustrations will need to be turned into [vector drawings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics). Simple illustrations you can do yourself. These might include,
* Charts & Graphs
* Timelines
* Maps
* Flowcharts
* Model Drawings

These can be created in MS Visio, MS Excel, Google Draw, [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), Omnigraffle, Adobe Illustrator and numerous others.

If you can generate an SVG or EPS file, any graphic designer can color and style them to match the rest of the book design.

Complex illustrations you should outsource to a graphic designer on [Fiverr.com](http://www.fiverr.com/s2/5b6f3fd894) or similar.

Illustrations can be a good substitute for photographs you can't obtain or license to use.
