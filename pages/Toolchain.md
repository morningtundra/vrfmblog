Social Media marketing (SMM) is often thought of as incredibly time consuming. The key to using these channels effectively is automation. Services like Later.com and Facebook's Creator Studio allow you to create and schedule content out months ahead of time. Services like Zapier.com allow content to be duplicated across several channels. e.g. a pre-scheduled post to Instagram and be automatically copied to Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest.
