During your book [Planning](Planning.md) you will have been collecting data like  snippets, photos, measurements, notes, fonts, doodles, color palets etc. If you haven't done so, dump them all in a document called, Design Brief.

# Design Brief
A formally written design brief serves two purposes.

1. Capture and clarify your goals and criteria
2. Saves repeating yourself when engaging subcontractors

The internet is full of guidance on how to write graphic design brief. For a book, keep it to two pages or less. At a minimum it should include the following,

* A demographic description of your target reader
* Trim size
* Target word and page count
* Planned price point or range
* Photo examples of what you like and a description of why
* Links to competing books
* Suggested color pallet and font styles

# Cover Design & Dust Jackets
Contrary to popular opinion, yes you *can* design your own cover. If you want to, or can't afford a graphic designer, go ahead and do your own. This advice does not apply equally to fiction.

While [assessing the compatitive landscape](Planning.md) during your Planning you will have seen many cover designs. While your personal preferences are important you must dispassionately decide,

* Which designs stand out on bookstore shelves?
* Which work equally well at thumbnail size on Amazon?
* What does the #1 Best Seller look like?
* What do these titles have in common?

# Website & Landing Pages

There is an important distinction between a website and a product landing page. For the purposes of selling a few books, a collection of one-page landing pages is more than sufficient. This is preferable to a full-blown website with complex cross-linking.

The purpose of a landing page is to convert a visitor into a book sale. Outbound or cross-site links distract a potential customer from responding to the Call To Action (Buy Now).

The optimum structure of a book landing page is well established. It includes the following elements,

* Product Image(s) or Video (book trailer)
* Social Proof (testimonials)
* Call to action (buy button)
* Short concise sales copy (description)
* Short author blurb
* Guarantees & Assurances
* Seller contact info

There sequence of these elements may vary and A/B testing may be useful to optimize the effectiveness. This is a pretty standard landing page setup
