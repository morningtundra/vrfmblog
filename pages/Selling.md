# Selling
If your goal is to see your name on the cover of your work or the shelves of a bookstore, you are a vanity author and you can ignore this section.

If your goal is to sell enough books to turn a profit, then this guidance will help you focus your time and budget.

While retailers and resellers will try to market and sell your book, none will try harder than you. Their efforts often look lacklustre and half hearted to the author. Establishing your own sales channels can profitable. 

***IMPORTANT NOTE*** 

Do not engage in price competition and attempt to undercut prices at Amazon. The Amazon algorithm scans the internet for retailers attempting to compete on price and will price match them. 

You could trigger a price war and drive down the price of your book! The goal is not to steal traffic or market share from Amazon but build your own market at the full retail price. While it's reasonable to run periodic discounts, make them seasonal and use discount coupon codes rather than publicly discount the retail price. 

## Amazon
[**Amazon**](https://www.amazon.com/books) is increasingly the default global sales platform. It deserves both your respect and fear. It can make or break your book.

In addition to listing your book, processing payments and fulfilling orders, it offers [Amazon Advertizing Services](https://advertising.amazon.com/) (in-platform advertising), [Amazon Affiliate Services](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/) and rudimentary sales analytics. Some authors focus exclusively on this platfom and prosper.

The one significant criticism of relying exclusively on Amazon - they offer no direct communication with customers (beyond the Customer Review and star rating functionality). Without this there can be no attribution of sales to any non-Amazon advertizing spend. This is especially try of any seasonal promotions or discount codes you may want to employ.

Your self-published book can make it into the Amazon catalog through two channels

1. Publishing using Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP)
2. Ordered by Amazon from established distributers

## Ebay

[**Ebay**](https://www.ebay.com) matters. This is where retailers unload unwanted/unsold/non-returnable inventory. Small bookstores use Ebay as an additional store front. Ebay is also the final destination for pre-owned books. Many will be sold at or even above retail, to buyers using Ebay or PayPal credit cards (affording them credits and points). 

It is not hard to secure some of this market share if you are willing to fulfill orders. You should consider this because, 
* You can buy inventory cheaper than competing seller.
* On each sale you can make more profit than competing seller.
* You have access to unlimited inventory.
* You can use your own marketig assets like book mocks and illustrations.

Your decision whether to participate in this market place depends on whether you're willing to fulfill your own orders (pack and mail) and deal with any customer feedback.

## Going DIY with Github Pages

This is the lowest cost (free) option. Github is a public repository (owned by Microsoft) for software projects. It offers a relatively simple way to host free web pages.

It has the advantage of not charging for using your own custom domain name. Domain names can be registered at various sites online for free too. It can be tedious to learn to setup if you're not familiar with GitHub, but can be simple to maintain once running.

A GitHub page can use a PayPal hosted cart and is relatively simple to setup.

With some time and patience, very nice landing pages can be created for zero budget.

# Integrated Sales & Marketing Platforms

If you're serious about taking your book to market, you will need more than hosted landing pages. These other tools include mailing list managers, payment gateways, analytics and reports.

While there are various place online that offer each of these and sold separately, fully integrated solutions (all-in-one) are limited. These are the best options at the time of writing.

- Kartra
- ClickFunnels
- Book Funnel
- Shopify


### KARTRA

I used Kartra for nearly two years before cancelling my subscription. While the platform is full-featured, it's aimed at *marketeers* selling knowledge products such as coaching and training courses. If your book is supported by these services, Kartra may be a good choice as it offers tight integrations like, 
- Membership Portals
- Affiliate Management
- Appointment scheduling

For a simple landing page, it's overkill. 

# Payment Processing
If you plan to sell direct you need at least one of these platforms to process your payments. Both charge merchant transaction fees.

- Paypal
- Stripe
