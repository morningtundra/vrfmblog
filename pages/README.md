# Independently Self-Publishing Non-Fiction
A formulary for independent authors to self-publish non-fiction books. This is based on my experience with the Vintage Rolex Field Guides, Classic and Chevalier Editions.

This guide is *not* designed to be read end to end, front to back. Dip into the Sections relevant to the stage you're at. It's a reference guide, not a novel.
