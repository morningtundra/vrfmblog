# Editing
Editing books is a professional craft, and while many people can proof-read and offer you feedback, it is definitely worth paying a dispassionate and neutral professional. 

Acquaintances or family members will struggle to give you negative feedback. Clear and direct criticism is essential to correcting the weakest parts of your work.

The editing phase is not fun or fast, but it is absolutely necessary. Budget for it and brace yourself for the critical feed back. Suck it up cupcake, this is good for you and your book.

Save yourself embarasment and defer any peer-review until your manuscript has passed through the hands of a professional editor.

## Where To Find An Editor And What To Pay

* The [Editorial Freelancers Association](https://www.the-efa.org/) maintain a directory of members and publish [prevailing rates and charges](https://www.the-efa.org/rates/). EFA is not involved in commercial transactions between you and their members.

* [Fiverr](http://www.fiverr.com/s2/5b6f3fd894) has numerous freelance book editors along with client feedback and seller ratings. Payment is managed through their platform. 

* Reddit has many freelance editors seeking work (e.g. [r/hireaneditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/HireAnEditor/)). I used an freelancer called [Brijit Reed](http://brijitreed.com/) from this Subreddit. 

* Reedsy.com is popular for many self-publishing services including finding editors.


## Payment Methods & Structure

* Most freelancers accept PayPal. This is acceptable and preferable to wire transfer.

* If you select an editor through Fiverr.com (or similar) payment will be handled through their platform.

* It is common practice to split the editing fee with an initial advance payment (a deposit) and the balance on completion.

* A 50% advance is not unreasonable. For large books, milestone payments can be appropriate.

* Sharing card processing, transaction fees, and risk, is reasonable. For example, make the initial advance payment for "Professional Services" which charges the recipient 5% and comes with PayPal Payment Protections. Then make the final payment a "Friends & Family" or "Gift" payment, with no transactions fees and no payment protections.

* Don't waste your time or insult the editor with non-disclosure agreements. The legal costs to exercise one makes them practically unenforceable. And they just make you look paranoid and amateur.

## Types of Editing Services

* **Copy Editing** corrects spelling, grammar, vocabulary, punctuation, cross-references etc.
* **Developmental Editing** is a partnership to develop concepts, themes and structure. 
* **Line Editing** is similar to Copy Editing and focuses on restructuring sentences and vocabulary to improve narrative tone and flow.
* **Proof Reading** is focuses on typographical issues with typesetting and page layout.

## Editing Sequence & Workflow

1. Developmental Editors want to be involved as you complete a manuscript and will want to review chapters as they develop. More often than not, this is not the case and they're engaged after the first full draft is completed. They will help you restructure and reorganize to optimize overall flow and usability. 

2. Line Editing typically occurs after the structure of the manuscript is well established. This work may be combined with copy editing. The goal is to polish the manuscript from draft to final. 
   
   The work is best performed in the word processor with Track Changes turned on. Changes will be processed by the author.

3. Proof Reading is best performed after typesetting and layout has been finished. The typesetting process can introduce unexpected and undesirable anomalies which a proof reader will identify. 
   
   This work is best performed in a PDF that is a low-fidelity mock-up of what will be submitted for print. The PDF will be marked up with a tool like Adobe Acrobat or Mac Preview and changes processed by author of passed on to the book designer (typesetter).
