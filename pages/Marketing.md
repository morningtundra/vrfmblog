Marketing is a poorly defined term, but will be used here to mean targeting and engaging customers. [Advertising](Advertising.md) and [Selling](Selling.md) are therefore sub-domains.

## Lead Magnets
This is simply a free sample of your book, typically a chapter. It is given away in exchange for a potential customers email address. In sales parlance, this potential customer is a *lead*.

The temptation will be to hold back and avoid giving away the best parts of your book. Take a tip from movie trailers - which feature all the best parts, scenes, jokes and action. It is counter intuitive to give away your best content for free, but this is most likely to persuade people to pay for the rest. 

Lead magnets are at the heart of building a mailing list. It is a very transactional exchange - free gift for contact details. The contact details are then used as the start of a sales funnel. A sales funnel is a means of converting a lead to a sale. See the [Selling](Selling.md) section on Integrated Platforms.

## Social Media Footprint
Maintaining a social media posting cadence is essential to building followers and momentum. It's also crucial to priming the various algorithms which broadcast your posts. 

Posting can be tedious and time consuming to perform on an ad-hoc basis. Success depends on being able to prepare content in batches and schedule them out into the future for auto-publishing. This is the purpose of Social Media Management Tools. 

The easiest and cheapest place to begin is Later.com. This platform allows you to prepare content and schedule it for auto-publishing months in advance. You would set this up around your launch or seasonal promotion campaigns.

There are numerous freelancers on [Fiverr](http://www.fiverr.com/s2/5b6f3fd894) that can set this up for you (if you're really lazy).

Graphical assets are essential to a social media campaign. Assemble the following assets and convert them to jgp or png file formats.

* Book Images & Illustrations
* Author Profile Photo
* Book cover
* Book mockups

## Book Mockups

These are extremely cheap to produce and very versatile. All you need is a cover design either as a raster image (jpg, png) or a PDF. Numerous graphic designers offer these in [Fiverr](http://www.fiverr.com/s2/5b6f3fd894). Expect to pay US$5 - US$10 for 20 mockups. These can be used on,
* websites
* social media pages and posts
* ad creatives
* email funnels

You can prepare these assets while waiting for your book to be edited.

## Book Trailer Videos
There is little doubt that video helps to sell product. There *IS* doubt over the effectiveness of slick book trailer videos. 

Simple videos are very easy to create and if they help sell your book, you should make the effort. If for no other reason than retailers won't and they can be done for zero budget.

A simple phone video like this can be created in 15 mins with a cell phone and free apps. It is sufficient to show that your book is real and has actual content.

For your digital EPUB you can use QuickTime to make a screen recording. These can also be done with free video conferencing tools like zoom.us

With MS Powerpoint or Mac KeyNote you can produce something like this using your book mockup images. Both presentation tools can export to video formats like Quicktime. You can combine these with your phone video footage using iMovie or similar.

You can host these on YouTube or Vimeo and then embed them in your product landing pages and emails. You can also use them as video ads on the Google Display Network and target YouTube channels and other affinity groups.
