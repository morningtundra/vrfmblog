## Social Media Footprint
Maintaining a social media cadence is essential to building followers and momentum. This can be tedious and time consuming to perform on an ad-hoc basis.

Success depends on being able to prepare content in batches and schedule them out into the future for auto-publishing. This is the purpose of Social Media Management Tools. 

The easiest and cheapest place to begin is Later.com. This platform allows you to prepare content and schedule it for auto-publishing months in advance. There are numerous freelancers on [Fiverr](http://www.fiverr.com/s2/5b6f3fd894) that can set this up for you (if you're really lazy).

Graphical assets are essential to a social media campaign. Assemble the following assets and convert them to jgp or png file formats.

* Book Images & Illustrations
* Author Profile Photo
* Book cover
* Book mockups

## Book Mockups

These are extremely cheap to produce and very versatile. All you need is a cover design either as a raster image (jpg, png) or a PDF. Numerous graphic designers offer these in [Fiverr](http://www.fiverr.com/s2/5b6f3fd894). Expect to pay US$5 - US$10 for 20 mockups. These can be used on,
* websites
* social media pages and posts
* ad creatives
* email funnels

You can prepare these assets while waiting for your book to be edited.

## Book Trailer Videos
There is little doubt that video helps to sell product. There *IS* doubt over the effectiveness of slick book trailer videos. 

Simple videos are very easy to create and if they help sell your book, you should make the effort. If for no other reason than retailers won't and they can be done for zero budget.

A simple phone video like this can be created in 15 mins with a cell phone and free apps. It is sufficient to show that your book is real and has actual content.

With MS Powerpoint or Mac KeyNote you can produce something like this using your book mockup images. You can combine these with your phone vide using iMovie or similar.
